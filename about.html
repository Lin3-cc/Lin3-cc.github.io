I am a graduate student at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on 3D multi-object detection and tracking with multi-sensor fusion. Since 2021, I have been interning at the autonomous driving company Waytous and have participated in a key national project in China. I graduated from the Department of Intelligent Science and Technology at Qingdao University in 2021, during which I won a national second prize in a Class A competition for Chinese university students. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy drawing and playing the Erhu, a traditional Chinese musical instrument.
