<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Camera-based Birdâ€™s-Eye-View (BEV) 3D object detection is thoroughly challenging and essential in autonomous driving perception system for alleviating the impression caused by object overlap and occlusion effectively. 3D multi-object tracking is one of the most important perception tasks in autonomous driving system, which suffers from the narrow view provided by only one single camera. In this paper, we present a novel framework called BEVMOT, which combines multi-object detection and tracking task in a unified framework in a considerable inference speed. The encoder of our framework generates the 360 degree panoramic image around the ego-car in the bird's eyes view utilizing the multiple cameras equipped on the car to broaden the perception field. An efficient decoder composes of multi-head attention and deformable attention following by a multi-object detection and tracking head, which learn the object center point and tracking embedding for acquiring object boxes and tracking id directly without the NMS post-processing. Meanwhile, tracking branch utilize tracking embedding to initialize new trajectories, update existing trajectories and achieve data association frame-by-frame. Extensive experiments show that our approach represents wonderful performance on NuScenes datasets, which exceeds many classic methods in term of AMOTA and AMOTP metrics.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Efficient and accurate road boundary detection is a fundamental building component of the perception system for autonomous driving. Specially, the challenges for road boundary detection in surface mine are high generalization error of model and difficulty in boundary generation, which caused by diversity of samples along with scarcity for corresponding samples and complexity of terrain respectively. Therefore, a novel road boundary detection framework, which execute in a high efficiency way with considerable performance, is proposed for the problems mentioned above. Firstly, point cloud pre-processing methods, including point cloud down-sampling, filtering and clustering, are conducted for achieving clusters of objects in surface mine. Then, a meta random forest classification method, which combines meta learning and random forest for enhancing the generalization ability of the model and overcoming sample scarcity of surface mine, is proposed for classifying point cloud clusters of retaining wall on both side of the road. At last, the boundary of unstructured road is generated by conducting a series of post-processing methods corresponds to the unevenness and irregularity of unstructured road. Experiments are carried out on the collected and labeled datasets of surface mine. The results illustrate that our proposed method can effectively detect road boundary of surface mine in real-time with considerable performance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Cooperative trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles has garnered significant attention in structured environments, but corresponding methodologies for unstructured environments remains relatively underexplored. The unloading area, an integral component of open-pit mines, exemplifies a quintessential unstructured environment. Implementing cooperative planning for autonomous mining trucks (AMTs) within these unloading areas is crucial as the optimization of processes in these areas substantially enhances the overarching safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness of mining operations. Hence, enhancing the operational efficiency of AMTs in the unloading area can considerably elevate productivity levels of open-pit mines. This article focuses on the real-time cooperative trajectory planning problem for AMTs in such areas, which is challenging due to i) small and irregular space ii) complex operations iii) need for path stability and speed flexibility. We propose a decoupled multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) method that decomposes trajectory planning into path planning and speed planning. Specifically, we present driving behavior enhanced path planning and sequential real-time cooperative speed planning methods. Our method is compared with several state-of-the-art MVTP methods and proves to be both secure and efficient.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Point cloud segmentation for unstructured regions is challenging. Especially, the diversity and complexity of the terrains in surface mine make point cloud segmentation more difficult, which brings potential risks for autonomous driving. To solve this problem, a Variance and Slope ratio based Segmentation method, named VSSeg was proposed. The proposed VSSeg method takes advantage of the different distributions of scatter diagrams projected in the height direction to obtain the variance-based discriminant slope characteristics. And it uses the slope changes at critical points of the ground and the unstructured regions to achieve slope-ratio-based segmentation.</p>
